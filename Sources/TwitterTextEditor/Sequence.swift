     Enumerate elements one by one asynchronously.

     - Parameters:
       - queue: A dispatch queue to enumerate each element. It _MUST BE_ a serial queue or behavior is undefined.
         iteration is always executed on this queue. It's caller's responsibility to not modify the sequence
         simultaneously while the enumeration or the behavior is undefined.
       - completion: An optional block that is called at the end of enumeration.
       - body: A block called with each element and a `Next` block.
         It's caller's responsibility to call given `Next` block eventually with one of `SequenceForEachNextAction`,
         either `.continue` or `.break`.
         Otherwise, the enumeration will never end, and the `completion` block will never be called.
